                    <p>Friendships are a key part of life, bringing us support, joy, and a sense of belonging. But with our busy schedules, it can be tough to stay connected. Keeping up with what's going on in our friends' lives shows we care, and regularly interacting with them keeps our bonds strong. That's why staying informed and staying engaged are the two main essentials for maintaining great friendships.</p>

                <article class="flex flex-col gap-4">
                    <h3 class="text-lg font-bold">Informed</h3>
                    <p>Being informed is crucial for maintaining and strengthening friendships, as it shows we value and
                        care
                        for our friends. Remembering important details like birthdays and interests demonstrates
                        attentiveness, building trust and deepening connections. Knowing about their experiences allows
                        us
                        to offer timely support and advice, solidifying bonds. Ultimately, staying informed fosters
                        personalized and authentic interactions, essential for resilient friendships.</p>

                        with your friends every
                        day. A notification to remember the manual logging is enabled by default.</p>
                    <p>But this
                        can take time. The following features are full accessible without manual logging:</p>
